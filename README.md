# CS50 Course Completion üéì

Welcome to my **CS50** repository! This space showcases my journey through Harvard's renowned **Introduction to Computer Science** course, instructed by [David J. Malan](https://cs.harvard.edu/malan/). The course covered fundamental computer science concepts, diverse programming languages, and essential skills for effective problem-solving and technical thinking.

## Course Overview üìö

**CS50** provided a comprehensive introduction to the foundations of computer science. Here are some of the primary learning objectives and concepts covered throughout the course:

- **Programming Skills:** Developed proficiency in C and Python, and explored additional languages like SQL, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Flask.
- **Problem-Solving Techniques:** Enhanced my ability to think methodically, recognize patterns, and decompose complex problems into manageable parts.
- **Core Computer Science Topics:** Studied data structures (linked lists, hash tables, trees), algorithms (searching, sorting), and memory management (pointers, dynamic allocation).
- **Cybersecurity Awareness:** Learned about cryptographic techniques, threat models, secure data handling, and more.
  
Each week was structured to focus on a specific context, applying concepts to real-world scenarios and projects.
